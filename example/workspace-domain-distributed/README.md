# Domain-Distributed Specifications Workspace Example

This example demonstrates the **Pattern B Variant: Domain-Distributed Specifications Workspace** conforming to the Version 4 master blueprint. 

It shows how a single large repository workspace containing multiple distinct business domains can structure its specifications into independent domain-specific folders while maintaining a single, centralized `00_Documentation_Blueprint.md` authority and a shared non-authoritative references directory.

### Key Topology Characteristics:
* **Single Blueprint Authority:** Exactly one `00_Documentation_Blueprint.md` is present at the workspace level under `docs/`. No blueprint duplicates exist within the domain folders (`inventory/` or `finance/`).
* **Non-Authoritative Workspace References:** The `docs/references/` directory houses long-lived documents that must not override specification boundaries or the master blueprint.
* **Domain-Owned Specification Boundaries:** `inventory/` and `finance/` own complete BRD, PRD, User Story, Architecture, Mapping, Decision Log, and CHANGELOG sets.

## 2. Local Specification Identity & Collision Safety

Because each domain folder behaves as an independent Specification Boundary, local User Story IDs are scoped to the domain and can safely collide without causing naming conflicts. Canonical identities must preserve the boundary namespace:

| Specification Boundary | Local User Story ID | Canonical Product Identity | Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inventory** | `US-SEC-01` | `Inventory::US-SEC-01` | Secure stock room access control |
| **Finance** | `US-SEC-01` | `Finance::US-SEC-01` | Multi-factor authorization for ledger adjustments |

---

## 3. Short Requirement Mapping Example

The following example mapping table preserves the `Specification Boundary + User Story ID` namespace context. This ensures traceability remains intact when domain requirements map to shared execution boundaries (e.g., a shared backend or web boundary):

| Specification Boundary | User Story ID | Verification Criteria ID | Execution Boundary | Boundary Role | Execution Reference | Release Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Inventory | **Inventory::US-SEC-01** | `BE-INV-SEC-001` | Backend | requirement_owner | [CHANGELOG.md](./apps/backend/CHANGELOG.md#BE-INV-SEC-001) | `Boundary v1.0.0` |
| Inventory | **Inventory::US-SEC-01** | `FE-INV-SEC-001` | Frontend | supporting_boundary | [ROADMAP.md](./apps/frontend/ROADMAP.md#FE-INV-SEC-001) | `Pending` |
| Finance | **Finance::US-SEC-01** | `BE-FIN-SEC-001` | Backend | requirement_owner | [CHANGELOG.md](./apps/backend/CHANGELOG.md#BE-FIN-SEC-001) | `Boundary v1.0.0` |

## 4. Validation Rules Summary

1. **No Duplicate Blueprints:** There must not be copies of `00_Documentation_Blueprint.md` inside `inventory/` or `finance/`.
2. **Namespace Preservation:** Mappings and cross-references must prefix story IDs with their domain (e.g., `Inventory::US-SEC-01`).
3. **Reference Authority Limits:** Documents inside `docs/references/` must not define new requirement criteria or override blueprint/domain specifications.
